These are partial, original schematics for the Cyberamic Control System.

The Backplane, Character, and Light Driver schematics seem to be accurate.
However, I do not have a J-19 on my Backplane, nor traces coming from those pins.

I do not have a Solenoid board, or a Transport board, but they seem to be reasonable from the pictures I've seen.

The Audio board schematic is still not found.  I hope to trace the one at History San Jose.

The Audio board was the first board to become obsolete, with the Cyberstar upgrade.
Hence information on it is very hard to come by.
