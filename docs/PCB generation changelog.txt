PTT cards changelog

audio

	audio board 0003 rev c
		baseline based on what we have now
		
	audio board 0033 rev a
		added mux controlled by CA2/CB2
		added mux-ed audio out
		removed two of the individual AGC'd but not muxed channels
		amps from previous revision used for muxed output channel
		the logo got rotated and moved
		
character

	Character board 0004 rev.a
		baseline based on what we have now
		
	Character board 0004 rev.b
		shrank the length to the standard dimension
			in doing so the logo got rotated
		
	Character board 0034 rev.a
		removed analog mux section from the 0004 rev.b board
		resistor network became separate resistors
		12v and -12v capacitor locations still exist, as well as test points
		newer smaller square logo
	
	Character board 0034 rev.d
		modern style board (~1993)
		removed all unused chip positions
		switched jumper block to dip switch with warning
		changed to fuse holder instead of solder fuse
		added 24v/5v jumpers for outputs (a/v switcher function)
		went to SIP resistor pack to consolidate things
		removed all 12v and -12v parts and test points
		new silk screen logo
		may have changed the ref des, not on the silk
		
	Character board 0034 rev.e
		24v/5v jumpers now have a default link setting for 24v
		new multi-footprint capacitors
		slight unexplained layout changes
		change of ref des confirmed on the silk 
		
light

	Light board 0021 rev.a
		based off of Character board 0004 rev.b
		removes analog components, but reserves two of the footprints for spare spots, one with power
		removes all 12v and -12v components including test points
		two extra bits for a total of 16
		extra bits use two unused gates of the 7406, not another uln2003a
		has the 50 pin connector for lights, not the character connector
		removed spare sockets and relocated components
		
		
	Light board 0021 rev.f
		based off of Character board 0034 rev.e
		no jumpers for output voltage, only 24v
		two extra bits for a total of 16
		extra bits use two unused gates of the 7406, not another uln2003a
		has the 50 pin connector for lights, not the character connector
		
transport
	
	Transport board 0020 rev.a (speculation)
		the baseline for this series of boards is rev.b but the 1982 paper schematic has some clues
		U8 was probably a nand gate for sending serial data out
			this was potentially going to be 9600 baud, but it seems to always have been 4800 in production
		
	Transport board 0020 rev.b
		removed data out nand gate
		otherwise baseline for this series
		
	Transport board 0020 rev.d
		added AH5012 to attenuate incoming data during fast forward and rewind
		this was backported to at least one older transport audio card rev.b
		
cpu

	CPU board 0001 rev.a
		the baseline for this series of boards
		The schematic has inconsistencies with the copper layer on the board
			Two connections have to be made with jumpers (my version adds them in the copper and notes it in silkscreen)
			One connection looks like it was pulled up (mine keeps the via but not the trace)
			The ground net is not fully connected (I didn't change this, it should still work on the backplane that joins it)
			Some pins the schematic claims are grounded are not, no effect on performance
	
	CPU board 0001 rev.b
		This fixes the two jumpers and one cut track from rev.a
		ground problems not fixed
		C3 changed from 10v to 16v, maybe because the 16v ones are cheaper at this point
		everything else seems to be the same
		
	CPU board 0001 rev.c
		only the label calling it rev.c changed
		I did not see any trace changes
		
	CPU board 0001 rev.d
		cut connections to alternate power supplies
		made U20/U22 inoperable
		Made U21 remap to a 2732
