# Cyberstar 1.6 EPROM image disassembly/reassembly - WIP

The "Cyberamic Control Center" was the original animatronic control computer designed for Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre in the late 1970s.

The first generation machine utilized a 6502 processor, and was used from around 1977 until the late 1980s.  This machine played programs from a Reel to Reel tape deck.

The second generation machine upgraded the CPU to a 68HC11F1 processor, and was used from the late 1980s to the mid 2000s.  This machine played programs from an SVHS tape on a VCR.

This is the disassembly of the ROM image from a 2nd generation machine.
